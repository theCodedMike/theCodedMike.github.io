Better yet, the language<br> is designed to guide you naturally towards reliable code that is efficient in<br> terms of speed and memory usage.</p><p>Programmers who are already working with low-level code can use Rust to raise their<br> ambitions. For example, introducing parallelism in Rust is a relatively low-risk<br> operation: the compiler will catch the classical mistakes for you. And you can<br> tackle more aggressive optimizations in your code with the confidence that you<br> won&#39;t accidentally introduce crashes or vulnerabilities.</p><p>But Rust isn&#39;t limited to low-level systems programming. It&#39;s expressive and ergonomic<br> enough to make CLI apps, web servers, and many other kinds of code quite pleasant to<br> write — you&#39;ll find simple examples of both later in the book. Working with Rust<br> allows you to build skills that transfer from one domain to another; you can learn<br> Rust by writing a web app, then apply those same skills to target your Raspberry Pi.</p><p>This book fully embraces the potential of Rust to empower its users. It&#39;s a friendly<br> and approachable text intended to help you level up not just your knowledge of Rust,<br> but also your reach and confidence as a programmer in general. So dive in, get ready<br> to learn—and welcome to the Rust community!</p><p>— Nicholas Matsakis and Aaron Turon</p>',8)])])}]]),i=JSON.parse('{"path":"/rust/the_book/foreword.html","title":"Foreword","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Foreword","icon":"note","date":"2023-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","category":"Rust Syntax","tag":["Foreword"],"description":"Foreword It wasn\'t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about empowerment: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to r...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Foreword\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-09-24T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2023-09-26T18:44:45.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Mike\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://thecodedmike.github.io/rust/the_book/foreword.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Mike\'s Blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Foreword"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Foreword It wasn\'t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about empowerment: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to r..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale:alternate","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2023-09-26T18:44:45.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Foreword"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-09-24T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2023-09-26T18:44:45.000Z"}],["link",{"rel":"alternate","hreflang":"zh-cn","href":"https://thecodedmike.github.io/zh/rust/the_book/foreword.html"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1695488460000,"updatedTime":1695753885000,"contributors":[{"name":"mike","username":"mike","email":"lixiaofeng1115@outlook.com","commits":3,"url":"https://github.com/mike"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.35,"words":406},"filePathRelative":"rust/the_book/foreword.md","excerpt":"<h2>Foreword</h2>\\n<p>It wasn\'t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally<br>\\nabout empowerment: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers<br>\\nyou to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains<br>\\nthan you did before.</p>\\n<p>Take, for example, \\"systems-level\\" work that deals with low-level details of memory<br>\\nmanagement, data representation, and concurrency.
