## Greedy
**Greedy algorithms** are a class of algorithms that make **locally optimal** choices at each step with the hope of finding a **global optimum** solution. In these algorithms, decisions are made based on the information available at the current moment without considering the consequences of these decisions in the future. The key idea is to select the best possible choice at each step, leading to a solution that may not always be the most optimal but is often good enough for many problems.

### Advantages of Greedy Approach
- The algorithm is easier to describe.
- This algorithm can perform better than other algorithms (but, not in all cases).

### Drawback of Greedy Approach
As mentioned earlier, the greedy algorithm doesn't always produce the optimal solution. This is the major disadvantage of the algorithm
